The Cake.

[Made for Chat's 1 year anniversary!]

Create a cake to celebrate a group chat's 1 year of existing!
Start by posting messages, then create arguments to reset all of your current progress and get heat.
Then start creating candles by sacrificing messages and heat.
Once you're done with the candles, start creating dough and icing for the cake.

More will be coming soon!
